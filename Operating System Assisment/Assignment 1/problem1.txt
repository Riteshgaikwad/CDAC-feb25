cdac@LAPTOP-8R6QQIBT:~$ ls
LinuxAssignment  feb25



b) File Management:
a. Inside the "LinuxAssignment" directory, create a new file named "file1.txt". Display its
contents.
---->
cdac@LAPTOP-8R6QQIBT:~$ cd LinuxAssignment
cdac@LAPTOP-8R6QQIBT:~/LinuxAssignment$ touch file1.txt
cdac@LAPTOP-8R6QQIBT:~/LinuxAssignment$ nano file1.txt
cdac@LAPTOP-8R6QQIBT:~/LinuxAssignment$ cat file1.txt
Hello,
This is a demo text file. we will print the content of this file.
cdac@LAPTOP-8R6QQIBT:~/LinuxAssignment$



c) Directory Management:
a. Create a new directory named "docs" inside the "LinuxAssignment" directory.
--->
cdac@LAPTOP-8R6QQIBT:~/LinuxAssignment$ mkdir docs
cdac@LAPTOP-8R6QQIBT:~/LinuxAssignment$ ls
docs  file1.txt
cdac@LAPTOP-8R6QQIBT:~/LinuxAssignment$



d) Copy and Move Files:
a. Copy the "file1.txt" file into the "docs" directory and rename it to "file2.txt".
--->
cdac@LAPTOP-8R6QQIBT:~/LinuxAssignment$ cp file1.txt docs/file2.txt
cdac@LAPTOP-8R6QQIBT:~/LinuxAssignment$ cd docs
cdac@LAPTOP-8R6QQIBT:~/LinuxAssignment/docs$ ls
file2.txt
cdac@LAPTOP-8R6QQIBT:~/LinuxAssignment/docs$ cat file2.txt
Hello,
This is a demo text file. we will print the content of this file.
cdac@LAPTOP-8R6QQIBT:~/LinuxAssignment/docs$


e) Permissions and Ownership:
a. Change the permissions of "file2.txt" to allow read, write, and execute permissions for
the owner and only read permissions for others. Then, change the owner of "file2.txt" to
the current user.

a. Finally, list the contents of the "LinuxAssignment" directory and the root directory to
ensure that all operations were performed correctly.
g) File Searching:
a. Search for all files with the extension ".txt" in the current directory and its subdirectories.

./file1.txt
./docs/file2.txt
